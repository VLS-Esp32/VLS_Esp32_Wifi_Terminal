# VLS_Esp32_Wifi_Terminal
This is a library for arduino IDE for creating serial interface between ESP32 and pc, can work with esp8266, with kernel 2.3.0 and below.

For monitoring, you need an application from the "soft" folder in the root directory of the library.

To connect, you need a local ip ESP32, in the future I plan to complete the ability to auto-detect ESP32 in the network.

The library replicates most of the Serial functions from the original library.

See Arduino ide examples for more information. 

To install the library, rename the folder to VLS_Esp32_Wifi_Terminal, and put it in the folder with your Arduino libraries
